				"question": "Who can attend?",
				"answers": [

Regardless of your experience, education, or background, as long as you are excited about learning, building, and having fun, we’d love for you to attend. If you are currently under the age of 18, please contact our team at hello@tamuhack.com to fill out a waiver form."

				]
			},
			{
				"question": "How much experience do I need?",
				"answers": [
					"Absolutely zero! We want you here because you have a passion for creating, not because you’re the most experienced hacker on the block. We’ll have lots of resources including workshops and a bunch of mentors to help beginners get started. There'll also be plenty of people to learn from and help out!"
				]
			},
			{
				"question": "How much does it cost?",
				"answers": [

				]
			},
			{
				"question": "What should I bring?",
				"answers": [
					"Please bring a valid student ID in addition to anything that would help you with creating your hack or making you comfortable. A laptop, charger, mouse, keyboard, hardware, light jacket, and any hygienic products should be helpful. Don't bring anything you wouldn't bring on an airplane."
				]
			},
			{
				"question": "How do teams work?",
				"answers": [
					"Teams are limited to 1-4 hackers. If you have a team in mind, make sure all members submit an application before the deadline. If you don't have a team and would like to be a part of one, no worries! We'll have a dedicated time for team formation after the opening ceremony. Teams are only finalized when the final Devpost submission is due."
				]
			},
			{
				"question": "Will there be travel reimbursements?",

				"question": "Can I stay in the MSC overnight?",
				"answers": [
					"Yes, however, you will not be able to re-enter the MSC after its closing time, so plan accordingly."
				]
			},
			{
				"question": "I got waitlisted. What does that mean?",
				"answers": [
					"Due to space limitations of the MSC, we are only able to accept 750 hackers. We will have a waitlist line for students who are not accepted. Starting at 11AM, we will admit people from the waitlist line until the MSC capacity has been reached."
				]
			},
			{
				"question": "Will there be workshops or talks?",

				]
			},
			{
